## üìò Abstract
This project introduces an advanced-level **AI voice assistant** for high-quality speech interaction between users and machines. By combining **Speech-to-Text (STT)** and **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** technologies, the assistant can take commands via voice and reply through speech‚Äîenabling natural, hands-free conversation.  

The assistant is capable of:
- Opening websites and applications  
- Hotword detection  
- WhatsApp calls/video calls  
- Playing YouTube videos  
- Web searches  

Built with **Python** and APIs, this project demonstrates logic flow and rule-based decision-making without relying on machine learning. It emphasizes **accessibility, productivity, and flexibility**, laying the groundwork for future advancements in AI-powered assistants.

## üìù Introduction
In recent years, voice assistants such as **Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant** have revolutionized human-computer interaction. Inspired by these technologies, our project presents a **custom AI-based voice assistant** that performs **reliable STT and TTS** for natural human-computer interactions.  

Key highlights:
- Understands spoken commands and responds verbally  
- Integrates with tools and services (emails, scheduling, searches)  
- Built entirely with **Python** and open-source APIs  
- Cost-effective, customizable, and scalable  

This project bridges **theoretical AI concepts** with **real-world applications**, providing a hands-on learning experience in NLP, automation, and accessibility.

- Customizable voice (speed, gender, accent)  

### 5.4 Core Functionalities
- Open websites/apps  
- WhatsApp calls  
- Play YouTube videos  
- Web search with APIs  

### 5.5 Logic & Workflow
Example:
```
python
if "play music" in command:
    play_on_youtube(query)  
elif "send email" in command:
    send_email()  
Multithreading: Implement background processes for uninterrupted listening and task execution.
```
